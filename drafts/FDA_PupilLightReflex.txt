   abstract = {Aim: A range of nations, including countries of the European Union, Australia, and the Americas have recently implemented or proposed reforms to how they control cannabis use, thereby departing from traditional approaches of criminal prohibition that have dominated throughout most of the twentieth century. Given these policy developments and the widespread global use of cannabis, it is critically important to understand the possible risks associated with cannabis use in relation to major societal harms. Methods: This systematic review investigates the potential link between cannabis use and occupational injury. Consequently, it appraises all available current literature from five databases, following Cochrane and PRISMA guidelines. Results: Seven of the 16 reviewed studies show evidence supporting a positive association between cannabis use and occupational injury. One study shows evidence supporting a negative association and the remaining eight studies show no evidence of a significant relation. None of the studies assessed cannabis-related impairment. Only three of the reviewed studies show clear evidence that cannabis use preceded the occupational-injury event. Conclusion: The current body of evidence does not provide sufficient evidence to support the position that cannabis users are at increased risk of occupational injury. Further, the study quality assessment suggests significant biases in the extant literature are present due to potential confounding variables, selection of participants, and measurement of exposures and outcomes. Future high-quality evidence will be needed to elucidate the relation between cannabis use and occupational injury.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVE: Daily cannabis users develop tolerance to some drug effects, but the extent to which this diminishes driving impairment is uncertain. This study compared the impact of acute cannabis use on driving performance in occasional and daily cannabis users using a driving simulator. METHODS: We used a within-subjects design to observe driving performance in adults age 25 to 45 years with different cannabis use histories. Eighty-five participants (43 males, 42 females) were included in the final analysis: 24 occasional users (1 to 2 times per week), 31 daily users and 30 non-users. A car-based driving simulator (MiniSim, National Advanced Driving Simulator) was used to obtain two measures of driving performance, standard deviation of lateral placement (SDLP) and speed relative to posted speed limit, in simulated urban driving scenarios at baseline and 30 min after a 15 min ad libitum cannabis smoking period. Participants smoked self-supplied cannabis flower product (15% to 30% tetrahydrocannabinol (THC). Blood samples were collected before and after smoking (30 min after the start of smoking). Non-users performed the same driving scenarios before and after an equivalent rest interval. Changes in driving performance were analyzed by repeated measures general linear models. RESULTS: Mean whole blood THC cannabinoids concentrations post smoking were use THC = 6.4 +/- 5.6 ng/ml, THC-COOH = 10.9 +/- 8.79 ng/mL for occasional users and THC = 36.4 +/- 37.4 ng/mL, THC-COOH = 98.1 +/- 90.6 ng/mL for daily users. On a scale of 0 to 100, the mean post-use score of subjective high was similar in occasional users and daily users (52.4 and 47.2, respectively). In covariate-adjusted analysis, occasional users had a significant increase in SDLP in the straight road segment from pre to post compared to non-users; non-users decreased by a mean of 1.1 cm (25.5 cm to 24.4 cm) while occasional users increased by a mean of 1.9 cm (21.7 cm to 23.6 cm; p = 0.02). Daily users also increased adjusted SDLP in straight road segments from baseline to post-use (23.2 cm to 25.0 cm), but the change relative to non-users was not statistically significant (p = 0.08). The standardized mean difference in unadjusted SDLP from baseline to post-use in the straight road segments comparing occasional users to non-users was 0.64 (95% CI 0.09 - 1.19), a statistically significant moderate increase. When occasional users were contrasted with daily users, the baseline to post changes in SDLP were not statistically significant. Daily users exhibited a mean decrease in baseline to post-use adjusted speed in straight road segments of 1.16 mph; a significant change compared to slight speed increases in the non-users and occasional users (p = 0.02 and p = 0.01, respectively). CONCLUSION: We observed a decrement in driving performance assessed by SDLP after acute cannabis smoking that was statistically significant only in the occasional users in comparison to the nonusers. Direct contrasts between the occasional users and daily users in SDLP were not statistically significant. Daily users drove slower after cannabis use as compared to the occasional use group and non-users. The study results do not conclusively establish that occasional users exhibit more driving impairment than daily users when both smoke cannabis ad libitum.},

   abstract = {Past research on cannabis has been limited in scope to THC potencies lower than legally available and efforts to integrate the effects into models of driving performance have not been attempted to date. The purpose of this systematic review is to understand the implications for modeling driving performance and describe future research needs. The risk of motor vehicle crashes increases 2-fold after smoking marijuana. Driving during acute cannabis intoxication impairs concentration, reaction time, along with a variety of other necessary driving-related skills. Changes to legislation in North America and abroad have led to an increase in cannabis' popularity. This has given rise to more potent strains, with higher THC concentrations than ever before. There is also rising usage of novel ingestion methods other than smoking, such as oral cannabis products (e.g., brownies, infused drinks, candies), vaping, and topicals. The PRISMA guidelines were followed to perform a systematic search of the PubMed database for peer-reviewed literature. Search terms were combined with keywords for driving performance: driving, performance, impairment. Grey literature was also reviewed, including congressional reports, committee reports, and roadside surveys. There is a large discrepancy between the types of cannabis products sold and what is researched. Almost all studies that used inhalation as the mode of ingestion with cannabis that is around 6% THC. This pales in comparison to the more potent strains being sold today which can exceed 20%. Which is to say nothing of extracts, which can contain 60% or more THC. Experimental protocol is another gap in research that needs to be filled. Methodologies that involve naturalistic (real world) driving environments, smoked rather than vaporized cannabis, and non-lab certified products introduce uncontrollable variables. When considering the available literature and the implications of modeling the impacts of cannabis on driving performance, two critical areas emerge that require additional research: The first is the role of cannabis potency. Second is the route of administration. Does the lower peak THC level result in smaller impacts on performance? How long does potential impairment last along the longer time-course associated with different pharmacokinetic profiles. It is critical for modeling efforts to understand the answers to these questions, accurately model the effects on driver performance, and by extension understand the risk to the public.},

   abstract = {Driving under the influence of alcohol (DUIA) and drugs (DUID) is considered an elevated risk for traffic safety. When assessing a driver's fitness to drive, standardized and objective measurement methods are still required, in order to clarify the question whether an individual is under the influence of substances acting on the central nervous system (CNS). We exposed healthy test subjects (n=41) as well as persons who were under the influence of cannabis after repeated inhalation to multiple light stimuli using infrared technology and measured the pupillary light reflex (PLR). Toxicological tests of blood samples taken from every subject followed. The aims of this study were to assess the differences in pupillography response between cannabis consumers after a washout period and no cannabis consumers as well as the dose related effects on pupillography parameters of cannabis in cannabis consumers. All four pupillary parameters changed according to a weakened pupil function after acute administration of cannabis in all test subjects. Furthermore, it could be observed that habitual cannabis consumers showed an altered pupillary function just before the first dose was taken, suggesting that the long-term effects and addiction also have to be taken into account, when effects of the CNS are discussed. The results of the present study show that almost all pupil parameters could be reliable indicators for the detection of subjects under the acute effect of cannabis.},

   abstract = {RATIONALE: Cannabis and alcohol are the most popular drugs amongst recreational users and most prevalent in injured and deceased drivers. The Standardized Field Sobriety Tests (SFST) are commonly used to establish impairment due to drugs and alcohol, but limited empirical evidence exists concerning the combined effects of these drugs on SFST performance. METHODS: The sample comprised 80 individuals (31 females; 49 males). Age ranged between 21 and 35 years (M = 26.5, SD = 5). Forty participants (15 females; 25 males) took part in the low alcohol condition (BAC, <0.05 %), and 40 participants (16 females; 24 males), took part in the high alcohol condition (BAC, >0.05 %). For each part of the study, two levels of ∆9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) were administered (1.8 and 3 % THC) or a matching placebo cigarette (0 % THC) in combination with alcohol. Performance on the SFST was assessed 30 min post-dosing. RESULTS: A number of significant differences in SFST performance were identified with 28 % of the sample failing the test (when the head movement and jerks sign was included) when low alcohol and low THC were administered together. When a higher dose of alcohol was administered with a low dose of THC, 38 % of the sample failed the test, and 35 % also failed when the high dose of alcohol was combined with a higher dose of THC. CONCLUSIONS: The current results highlight the limited ability of the SFST to identify drug consumption in the absence of any evidence of driving impairment or physiological indicators.},

This evolving legal environment, and growing scientific evidence of its effectiveness for select health conditions, requires assessment of the safety and appropriateness of marijuana within the American workforce. Although studies have suggested that marijuana may be used with reasonable safety in some controlled environments, there are potential consequences to its use that necessitate employer scrutiny and concern.

   abstract = {Objectives. To assess cannabis and alcohol involvement among motor vehicle crash (MVC) fatalities in the United States. Methods. In this repeated cross-sectional analysis, we used data from the Fatality Analysis Reporting System from 2000 to 2018. Fatalities were cannabis-involved if an involved driver tested positive for a cannabinoid and alcohol-involved based on the highest blood alcohol concentration (BAC) of an involved driver. Multinomial mixed-effects logistic regression models assessed cannabis as a risk factor for alcohol by BAC level. Results. While trends in fatalities involving alcohol have remained stable, the percentage of fatalities involving cannabis and cannabis and alcohol increased from 9.0% in 2000 to 21.5% in 2018, and 4.8% in 2000 to 10.3% in 2018, respectively. In adjusted analyses, fatalities involving cannabis had 1.56 (95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.48, 1.65), 1.62 (95% CI = 1.52, 1.72), and 1.46 (95% CI = 1.42, 1.50) times the odds of involving BACs of 0.01% to 0.049%, 0.05% to 0.079%, and 0.08% or higher, respectively. Conclusions. The percentage of fatalities involving cannabis and coinvolving cannabis and alcohol doubled from 2000 to 2018, and cannabis was associated with alcohol coinvolvement. Further research is warranted to understand cannabis- and alcohol-involved MVC fatalities. (Am J Public Health. 2021;111(11):1976-1985. https://doi.org/10.2105/AJPH.2021.306466).},

   abstract = {Establishing science-based driving per se blood Delta(9) -tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) limits is challenging, in part because of prolonged THC detection in chronic, frequent users. Therefore, documenting observable signs of impairment is important for driving under the influence of drugs. We evaluated frequent and occasional cannabis smokers' performance on the modified Romberg balance, one leg stand (OLS), and walk and turn (WAT) tasks, and pupil size effects following controlled placebo (0.001% THC), smoked, vaporized and oral (6.9% [~50.4 mg] THC) cannabis administration. Significant effects following inhaled doses were not observed due to delayed tasks administration 1.5 and 3.5 h post-dose, but significant impairment was observed after oral dosing (blood THC concentrations peaked 1.5-3.5 h post-dose). Occasional smokers' odds of exhibiting >/=2 clues on the OLS or WAT following oral dosing were 6.4 (95% CI 2.3-18.4) times higher than after placebo, with THC and 11-hydroxy-THC blood concentrations individually producing odds ratios of 1.3 (1.1-1.5) and 1.5 (1.3-1.8) for impairment in these tasks, respectively. Pupil sizes after oral dosing under the direct lighting condition were significantly larger than after placebo by mean (SE, 95% CI) 0.4 (0.1, 0.2-0.6) mm at 1.5 h and 0.5 (0.2, 0.2-0.8) mm at 3.5 h among all participants. Oral cannabis administration impaired occasional cannabis users' performance on the OLS and WAT tasks compared to placebo, supporting other reports showing these tasks are sensitive to cannabis-related impairment.

   abstract = {Cannabis is the most widely used illegal drug in the world. Limited information about the effects of cannabis on visual function is available, and more detail about the possible impact of visual effects on car driving is required. This study investigated the effects of smoking cannabis on vision and driving performance, and whether these effects are correlated. Twenty drivers and occasional users were included (mean (SE) age, 23.3 (1.0) years; five women). Vision and simulated driving performance were evaluated in a baseline session and after smoking cannabis. Under the influence of cannabis, certain visual functions such as visual acuity (p < 0.001), contrast sensitivity (p = 0.004) and stereoacuity (far, p < 0.001; near, p = 0.013) worsened. In addition, there was an overall deterioration of driving performance, with the task of keeping the vehicle in the lane proving more difficult (p < 0.05). A correlation analysis showed significant associations between driving performance and visual function. Thus, the strongest correlations were found between the distance driven onto the shoulder and stereoacuity, for near (rho = 0.504; p = 0.001) and far distances (rho = 0.408; p = 0.011). This study provides the first evidence to show that the visual effects of cannabis could impact driving performance, compromising driving safety. The results indicate that information and awareness campaigns are essential for reducing the incidence of driving under the influence of cannabis.},

   abstract = {Recent years have seen an explosion of activity in the field of functional data analysis (FDA), in which curves, spectra, images, etc. are considered as basic functional data units. A central problem in FDA is how to fit regression models with scalar responses and functional data points as predictors. We review some of the main approaches to this problem, categorizing the basic model types as linear, nonlinear and nonparametric. We discuss publicly available software packages, and illustrate some of the procedures by application to a functional magnetic resonance imaging dataset.},

   abstract = {Background: Cannabis is one of the drugs most often found in drivers involved in serious motor vehicle collisions. Validity and reliability of roadside cannabis detection strategies are questioned. This pilot study aimed to investigate the relationship between eye characteristics and cannabis effects in simulated driving to inform potential development of an alternative detection strategy. Materials and Methods: Multimodal data, including blood samples, eye-tracking recordings, and driving performance data, were acquired from 10 participants during a prolonged single-session driving simulator experiment. The study session included a baseline driving trial before cannabis exposure and seven trials at various times over approximately 5 h after exposure. The multidimensional eye-tracking recording from each driving trial for each participant was segmented into nonoverlapping epochs (time windows); 34 features were extracted from each epoch. Blood Delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) concentration, standard deviation of lateral position (SDLP), and mean vehicle speed were target variables. The cross-correlation between the temporal profile of each eye-tracking feature and target variable was assessed and a nonlinear regression analysis evaluated temporal trend of features following cannabis exposure. Results: Mean pupil diameter (r=0.81-0.86) and gaze pitch angle standard deviation (r=0.79-0.87) were significantly correlated with blood THC concentration (p<0.01) for all epoch lengths. For driving performance variables, saccade-related features were among those showing the most significant correlation (r=0.61-0.83, p<0.05). Epoch length significantly affected correlations between eye-tracking features and speed (p<0.05), but not SDLP or blood THC concentration (p>0.1). Temporal trend analysis of eye-tracking features after cannabis also showed a significant increasing trend (p<0.01) in saccade-related features, including velocity, scanpath, and duration, as the influence of cannabis decreased by time. A decreasing trend was observed for fixation percentage and mean pupil diameter. Due to the lack of placebo control in this study, these results are considered preliminary. Conclusion: Specific eye characteristics could potentially be used as nonintrusive markers of THC presence and driving-related effects of cannabis. clinicaltrials.gov (NCT03813602).},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Although the association of cannabis use with automobile accidents has been well-studied, the impact of cannabis on workplace safety and injuries is less clear. AIMS: The purpose of this study was to examine the relationship between work-related injury and cannabis use in the past year. METHODS: We performed a cross-sectional analysis of the Canadian Community Health Survey (2013-16) of working individuals. We used multiple logistic regression modelling to calculate the odds of experiencing a work-related injury (defined as non-repetitive strain injury) among workers who reported using cannabis more than once during the prior 12 months as compared to non-users. We repeated the analysis among participants working in high injury risk occupational groups only. RESULTS: Among the 136 536 working participants, 2577 (2%) had a work-related injury in the last 12 months. Of these 2577 who had a work-related injury, 4% also reported being a cannabis user in the same period. We found no association between past-year cannabis use and work-related injury (odds ratio for work injury among users 0.81, 95% confidence interval 0.66-0.99). The association was unchanged in the subgroup analysis limited to high injury risk occupational groups. CONCLUSIONS: We found no evidence that cannabis users experienced higher rates of work-related injuries. While awaiting prospective studies, occupational medicine practitioners should take a risk-based approach to drafting workplace cannabis policies.},
